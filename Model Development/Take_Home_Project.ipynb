We have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, governments and individuals. Our services are based on\n","comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments,\n","employment, income, demographic and marketing data. We use advanced statistical techniques and proprietary software tools to analyze all available data, creating customized\n","insights, decision-making solutions and processing services for our clients. We help consumers understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more\n","informed financial decisions. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. Additionally, we are a leading\n","provider of payroll-related and human resource management business process outsourcing services in the United States of America, or U.S.\n"," \n","We currently operate in four global regions: North America (U.S. and Canada), Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), Europe (the United Kingdom, or U.K.,\n","Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). We maintain support operations\n","in the Republic of Ireland. We also offer Equifax branded credit services in Russia and India through joint ventures, have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit\n","information companies through joint ventures in Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai, and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company\n","in Brazil.\n"," \n","Equifax was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1913, and its predecessor company dates back to 1899. As used herein, the terms\n","Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms\n","mean only Equifax Inc.\n"," \n","We are organized and report our business results in four operating segments, as follows:\n"," \n","•\n","U.S. Information Solutions (USIS)\n"," \n","—\n"," provides consumer and commercial information solutions to businesses in the U.S. including online information,\n","decisioning technology solutions, fraud and identity management services, portfolio management services, mortgage reporting and financial marketing services.\n","•\n","International\n"," —which includes our Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada and Latin America business units, provides products and services similar to those available in\n","the USIS operating segment but with variations by geographic region.

Criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to our network. Based\n","on our forensic investigation, the unauthorized access of information occurred from mid-May through July 2017. The information accessed primarily includes names, Social\n","Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. In addition, credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. and Canadian\n","consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers, were accessed. The investigation determined that\n","personal information\n","2\n"," \n","MARKETS AND CLIENTS\n"," \n","Our products and services serve clients across a wide range of verticals, including financial services, mortgage, employers, consumer, commercial,\n","telecommunications, retail, automotive, utilities, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments.

This could result in a situation where there are more limited resources available for acquisitions, potentially hindering the company's ability to pursue growth opportunities through joint ventures and acquisitions in emerging markets.\\n\\n2. **Impact on Management Focus:** The incident may have shifted management's focus away from actively seeking and developing potential acquisition and joint venture opportunities, resulting in decreased growth opportunities for Equifax in new geographical areas.\\n\\nTherefore, the breach may have hindered Equifax's capacity to expand its geographic reach through acquisitions and joint ventures by limiting resources, diverting management attention, and reducing growth opportunities.\",\n          \"The security breach that occurred at Equifax in 2017 was a cybersecurity incident involving a criminal attack on their systems. The breach resulted in the theft of personally identifiable information of U.S., Canadian, and U.K. consumers. The criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network. The unauthorized access occurred from mid-May through July 2017 and involved information such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some instances, driver\\u2019s license numbers. Additionally, credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. and Canadian consumers were accessed, along with certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers. About 19,000 Canadian consumers and approximately 860,000 potentially affected U.K. consumers were also impacted by the breach.\\n\\nNo evidence was found that Equifax's core consumer, employment and income, or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed during the cybersecurity incident. The company promptly notified the affected consumers and cooperated with law enforcement in investigating the incident. Equifax also took extensive steps to prevent such incidents in the future and rebuild trust with consumers, customers, and regulators, through enhanced data security infrastructure, substantial costs incurred for prevention measures, disclosures, and providing consumers with new tools to protect their credit data.\",\n          \"Equifax considers outsourcing their operations to be potentially harmful to their business because of the dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions. If the outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner, or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security, this could impair Equifax's ability to operate effectively. Additionally, if the outsourcing vendors increase prices for their services unreasonably, Equifax's ability to bring products to market and support its customers, as well as its reputation, could suffer. Furthermore, much of Equifax's outsourcing takes place in developing countries, which may introduce geopolitical uncertainty to their operations.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expert_answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Equifax's ability to use acquisitions and joint ventures to expand geographically in emerging markets may be hampered significantly by the breach.

However, the model answer includes additional details such as the data's international impact, the types of information accessed, and subsequent steps taken by Equifax, which were not requested in the original ground truth answer. While these extra details are accurate and relevant, they go beyond what was necessary to answer the question, leading to a slight reduction in score due to a focus on conciseness and relevance. Nonetheless, the response does not omit any important information about the breach itself, which is the primary focus of the question.\",\n          \"The model answer provides a comprehensive explanation, encapsulating the fundamental risks associated with outsourcing, including potential failures in performance and quality. It even goes further to highlight additional risks such as increased costs and geopolitical instability, which are not mentioned in the ground truth answer. However, these additional points, while relevant, do not directly pertain to the core reason related to unsatisfactory performance as stated in the ground truth. The model answer includes the key point about quality and timeliness affecting Equifax\\u2019s operations but does not focus solely on that aspect. Therefore, while the answer is highly informative and largely accurate, it somewhat diffuses the emphasis on the critical issue of service quality directly affecting product delivery.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":229}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['score'].mean()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"uSnictyB0hTM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717638081223,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Adhitya Venkatesh","userId":"09714276091462073085"}},"outputId":"5674f3dd-45e8-4279-fb12-26925ca7f4ea"},"execution_count":237,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["78.25"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":237}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["idx = 3\n","\n","print(df['model_responses'][idx])\n","print(df['expert_answers'][idx])\n","print(df['explanation'][idx])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"yM2K2hS92a4U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717637829917,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":143,"user":{"displayName":"Adhitya Venkatesh","userId":"09714276091462073085"}},"outputId":"1c8c54f7-1ce9-4a44-c970-067be46c5577"},"execution_count":232,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The document mentions that Equifax acted promptly to notify the affected consumers after the 2017 cybersecurity incident.
